          CTFs, short for Capture the Flags, are a type of Computer Security competition where you will try to hack into our systems, break our codes, and do fun things like that for points and learning!

          <p>
            There will be a list of 'problems' for you to solve. On solving then, you should end up with an 'answer string' called a 'flag'. You can submit this flag using the box next to the problem description and get points!

          Experienced CTFer? Or new to Capture The Flags? Either way, want to solve problems and win prizes without spending fourteen consecutive days on a CTF?

            <strong>Instead of a two-week sprint, PACTF will have three rounds,</strong> each one week long. During each round, you can pick any two-day span to grab as many flags as you can! Choose wisely: Once your two days run out, you won’t be able to score more points in that round.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Don’t worry about being too slow, though!</strong> Even if your two day timer is over, you can still test your skills against problems in previous rounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>There are scoreboards</strong>
            for each individual round, and there is an overall all-time scoreboard. Prizes will be given to the top-ranking teams of the individual rounds and the overall CTF, so whether you are a specialist or an all-rounder, there's something for you!
