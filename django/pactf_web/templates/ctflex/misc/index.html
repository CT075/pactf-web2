          CTFs, short for Capture the Flags, are a type of Computer Security competition where you will try to hack into our systems, break our codes, and do fun things like that for points and learning!

          <p>
            There will be a list of 'problems' for you to solve. On solving then, you should end up with an 'answer string' called a 'flag'. You can submit this flag using the box next to the problem description and get points!

            <strong>Instead of a two-week sprint, PACTF will have three rounds,</strong> each one week long. During each round, you can pick any two-day span to grab as many flags as you can! Choose wisely: Once your two days run out, you won’t be able to score more points in that round.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Don’t worry about being too slow, though!</strong> Even if your two day timer is over, you can still test your skills against problems in previous rounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>There are scoreboards</strong>
            for each individual round, and there is an overall all-time scoreboard. Prizes will be given to the top-ranking teams of the individual rounds and the overall CTF, so whether you are a specialist or an all-rounder, there's something for you!
