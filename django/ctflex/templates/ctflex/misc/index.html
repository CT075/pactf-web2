          CTFs, short for Capture the Flags, are a type of Computer Security competition where you hack, decrypt, reverse, and do whatever it takes to solve increasingly challenging security puzzles!

            There will be a list of ‘problems’ for you to solve. On solving a problem, you should end up with a string as an answer called a ‘flag’ (hence the term ‘Capture the Flag’). You can submit this flag using the text box next to the problem description for points and fun!

            <strong>Instead of a two-week sprint, {% include 'ctflex/text/title.txt' %} will have three rounds,</strong> each one week long. During each round, you can pick any {% include 'ctflex/text/timer_length.adjective.txt' %} span to grab as many flags as you can! Choose wisely: Once your {% include 'ctflex/text/timer_length.noun.txt' %} run out, you won’t be able to score more points in that round.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Don’t worry about being too slow, though!</strong> Even if your {% include 'ctflex/text/timer_length.adjective.txt' %} timer is over, you can still test your skills against problems in previous rounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>There are scoreboards</strong>
            for each individual round, and there is an overall all-time scoreboard. Prizes will be given to the top-ranking teams of the individual rounds and the overall CTF, so whether you are a specialist or an all-rounder, there's something for you!
